                <h3>Thomas Edison</h3>
                <p class="lead">The person whose world-changing invention was the result of a 1000 times failures. The bulb was such a great invention that it bred numerous future inventions on its back.

                    When Edison was a child, his teachers called his parents regularly and tell them that their child is weak and can never succeed in life. His teachers were convinced that teaching a brain as slow as his, is a waste of time.
                    
                    But no one knew that this person will invent so many things that people won’t forget him even after centuries! And the biggest learning of his success story were his 1000 attempts when he failed at his job. But he never stopped; his drive lead him to astonishing success and now he is one of the world’s most famous success stories.

                <h3>J.K Rowling</h3>
                <p class="lead">During a Harvard commencement speech, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling outlined the importance and value of failure.[1]

                    Why? Simply because she was once a failure too.
                    
                    A few short years after her graduation from college, her worst nightmares were realized. In her words,
                    
                    <p class="lead"><i>“I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.”</i></p>

                <h3>Walt Disney</h3>
                <p class="lead">Mickey Mouse creator Walt Disney dropped out of school at a young age in a failed attempt at joining the army.[3] One of his earlier ventures, Laugh-o-Gram Studios, went bankrupt due to his lack of ability to run a successful business. He was once fired from a Missouri newspaper for “not being creative enough.”

                    Yet today, The genius behind Disney studios is responsible for generations of childhood memories and dreams. From Snow White to Frozen, Disney will continue to entertain the world for generations to come.
                    
                    The logic behind this is simple:
                    
                    <p class="lead"><i>“We don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors, and doing new things, because we’re curious… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”</i></p>
                </p>

                <h3>Vincent Van Gogh</h3>
                <p class="lead">During his lifetime, Vincent Van Gogh suffered mental illness, failed relationships, and committed suicide at the age of 37.

                    He only ever sold one painting in his life, pinning him a failure as an artist. However that did not put a damper on his enthusiasm and passion for art.
                    
                    He would never know that years and years after his death he would become known as a key figure in the world of post-impressionism, and ultimately, one of the greatest artist that ever lived.
                    
                    He would never know that he became a hot topic in art classes and his image was going to be used in TV, books and other forms of popular culture.
                    
                    In the words of this great, but tragic man:
                    
                    <p class="lead"><i>"If you hear a voice within you say ‘you cannot paint,’ then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.”</i></p>

                <h3>Michael Jordan</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                <i>“I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”</i><br><br>
                    This quote by retired basketball legend Michael Jordan in a Nike advertisement speaks for itself.
                    
                    It would be an easy misconception that Jordan’s basketball skills revolve around natural talent. In fact, in his earlier years,  basketball coaches had trouble looking past the fact that Jordan didn’t reach the minimum height. It was years of effort, practice, and failure that made the star we know today.
                    
                    Michael Jordan’s success all came down to his Intrinsic Motivation, one of the most invincible types of motivation that drives people to succeed.

                <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
                <p class="lead">The now revolutionary Apple started off with two men in a garage. Years later we all know it as a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.

                    Yet, almost unbelievably, Steve Jobs was fired from the very company he began.
                    
                    The dismissal made him realize that his passion for his work exceeded the disappointment of failure. Further ventures such as NeXT and Pixar eventually led Jobs back to the CEO position at Apple. Jobs said in 2005:<br><br>
                    
                    <i>“I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.”<i>
