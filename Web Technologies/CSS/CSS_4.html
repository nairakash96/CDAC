				This chapter explores some of the nuts and bolts of text presentation and information
				layout. When I talk about text styles, I mean the specification of boldface,
				italics, and other changes that you can make to text. The preceding chapter
				showed you, in the proverbial one fell swoop, the basics of HTML document layout.
				But, as you’ve probably figured out, there’s much more to creating cool
				Web pages.

				When you were given your first box of crayons, you probably went wild and tried
				to use all the colors for each picture you colored. Eventually, however, it dawned
				on you (unless you were a young Peter Max) that a subset of colors can be much
				more useful and attractive. The same holds true for the various formatting commands
				in HTML. It is possible to use all the commands everywhere, but a better
				strategy is to use them only when they are most appropriate. Many Web pages
				already tend to be cluttered, and using too much italic or boldface typeface
				makes the clutter even worse.
			</p>

				Nevertheless, at times you want to highlight certain words, phrases, titles, names,
				or other information. In this chapter, you learn how to do that using HTML. A
				quick warning, however: In the next chapter you learn a completely different, and
				more modern, approach to formatting text using something called Cascading
				Style Sheets, or CSS. Although more complex, CSS offers dramatically greater
				control over the presentation of text (and much more). Purists lobby for CSS-only
				pages, but I’m not that hard core. I use a mélange of HTML and CSS to achieve
				the page results I seek, and I bet you will, too.
